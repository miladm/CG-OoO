In this paper I would like to point out the following achievements we have
made:

\begin{itemize} 
    \item energy efficient and high performance computing need for dynamism and
speculation (INTRO)
    \item compiler design
    \item architecture design
    \item pipeline energy efficiency opportunities
    \item ?
    \item results
    \item recovery time, energy, performance, register file behavior, LSQ,
wakeup logic information, having multiple issue elements from each BB
    \item simulation framework
    \item discussion
\end{itemize}
