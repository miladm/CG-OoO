\section{BB Register Renaming Model}
\label{sec:bb_reg_ren}

Upon a squash, we want to flush younger basic-blocks and invalidate any write
that has been done to the PR by checking the RAT. This way, the drain stage is
fully flushed out, making long-pipeline designs extremely affordable.

We still have to spend some cycles cleaning up the PR (but not nearly as must we
        would pay with RR model in OOO)

It is also much more energy efficient.
