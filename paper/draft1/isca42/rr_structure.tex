\subsection{BBE Register Rename Model}
\label{sec:bb_reg_ren}

BBE register renaming is energy efficient for two reasons. First it utilizes a
complexity effective design that requires one register aliasing table (RAT) as
opposed to multiple RAT's at different pipeline checkpoints.  Second, because a
significant fraction of registers are local, register renaming can be bypassed
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:pipeline}.

The use of fewer physical registers as well as a significantly smaller re-order
buffer (as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:bb_rob}) allow fast invalidation
of the squashing physical register entries and rolling back the RAT to the
oldest non-squashing physical register value. On a squash event, younger
basic-blocks entries in the re-order buffer roll back the register file and the
rename tables using their physical operands. On average 5 BB's are squashed with
an average of 4 global write operands. This amounts to an average roll back cycle
time of 5 cycles.
