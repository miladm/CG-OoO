\subsection{Squash Handling}
\label{sec:speculation}

In BBE, squash events are handled at basic-block granularity. To avoid wasting
{\it{useful}} instructions executed in a mis-speculated BB, the compiler uses
profiling information to separate weakly biased branches form the rest of the BB
into a single-instruction BB. Less than XX\% of useful instructions are wasted
in BBE.

The average number of BB's squashed per mis-prediction event is 6 where each
basic-block has an average of 3 global write operands. BBE is able to invalidate
register renaming entries within 5 cycles which is comparable to the number of
cycles OoO takes to restore a checkpoint and restart the execution. This
approach eliminates the need for both program checkpointing and a second
register alias table.

% how many cycles does it take to load a checkpoint?
% how much energy is it to track checkpoints?


%Memory mis-prediction is less likely in this model as each basicblock buffer
%runs in-order (no chance of mis-speculation between load-stores within a
%basicblock). We also say that mis-speculation handling is the same for
%both memory and branch.
