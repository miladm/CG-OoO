\subsection{Control Speculation}
\label{sec:speculation}

Mis-speculation handling is coarse grain, making it fast and energy efficient.
Discussion on number of wasted instructions.
Discussion on the changes in memory mis-speculation model.

%There are two kinds of speculation: memory and control.
%
%Control speculation: apart from the oldest basicblock in flight, all other
%in-flight basicblocks are speculatively fetched and executed. The key elements
%of speculation are: branch prediction, squash handling. Branch prediction is
%done energy efficiently and more accurately as only H instructions access BP.
%Squash handling is done coarse-grain meaning there is a chance that we lose
%useful instructions (SPEC shows that the number useful instructions flushed is
%small - I will add a figure to back it here). We also talk about how the number
%of cycles to ramp down from a squash is shorter in BB  OoO.
%
%Memory mis-prediction is less likely in this model as each basicblock buffer
%runs in-order (no chance of mis-speculation between load-stores within a
%basicblock). We also say that mis-speculation handling is the same for
%both memory and branch.
