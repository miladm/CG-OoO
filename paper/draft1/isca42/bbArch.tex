%%%%%%% ABSTRACT %%%%%%%
\begin{abstract}
Processor on-chip data movement and out-of-order execution bookkeeping overheads
are the key energy consumption factors in modern processors. This work minimize
these energy overheads via introducing compiler-generated latency hiding
techniques that enable near out-of-order performance while maintaining near
in-order energy overheads. Specifically, we introduce the notion of coarse-grain
program execution; in this computation model program basic-blocks are
speculatively run out-of-order while instructions within each basic-block run in
program order. Basic-block execution closes 90\% of the energy gap and 78\% of the
performance gap between in-order and out-of-order.
