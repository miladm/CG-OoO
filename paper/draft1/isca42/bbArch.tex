\begin{abstract}

The main factors contributing to the bulk of energy consumption in modern
out-of-order processors are the speculative logic units, dynamic instruction
scheduling modules, and on-chip data movement.  This work significantly reduces
these energy overheads via introducing compiler-generated techniques that enable
near in-order energy consumption while maintaining near out-of-order computation
performance. Specifically, we introduce the notion of coarse-grain program
execution; in this model, program basic-blocks are speculatively run
out-of-order while instructions within each basic-block run in-order.
Basic-block execution closes up to 90\% of the energy gap and 78\% of the
performance gap between in-order and out-of-order.
