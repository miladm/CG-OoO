\section{Simulation Framework}
\label{sec:simulation}

Discussion on the simulator parameters, use of Pintool, pinpoints, wrong-path
execution support, energy model integration.

Discussion on the benchmark

Simulator framework: pin, wrong-path, energy, speculation, function vs. timing
simulation, pin-points?

Discussion on the energy model estimate analysis for CAM, RAM, wire. Discussion
on area estimate as well.
