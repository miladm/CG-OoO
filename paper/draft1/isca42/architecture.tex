\section{Processor Architecture}
\label{sec:arch}

Coarse grain execution exposes energy saving opportunities in most pipeline
stages. In this section we discuss the flow of basicblocks through different
pipeline stages and elaborate on how energy is saved in each stage.

Below, we discuss the various architectural components of this architecture.
Figure XX illustrates the processor stages in detail.
