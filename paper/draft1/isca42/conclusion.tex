\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper presented the basic-block execution model to evaluate the positive
impact of coarse grain out-of-order execution on energy efficiency and
performance. BBE closes 70\% of the performance gap between InO and OoO while
closing 66\% of the energy gap. The performance and energy benefits of BB are
attributed to its effective BPU lookup model, efficient squash model, use BB
window, explicit data forwarding, and the use of local register files.
