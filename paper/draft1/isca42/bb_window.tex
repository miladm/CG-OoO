\subsubsection{Basicblock Window}
\label{sec:bb_window}

BB window is a small buffer, typically, with 16 entries to hold instructions. It
has a small buffer space to store the address of global read and write registers
of the basicblock operations. BB window is accessed in a FIFO manner as each basicblock is
designed to execute in-order.

This architecture has 16 basicblock window buffers allowing for concurrent
execution of instructions from multiple basicblocks speculatively. Each cycle,
the head of each buffer is accessed to issue ready instructions.  Instruction
scheduler issues instructions from older basicblocks first.

Figure XX shows the average number of in-flight basicblocks for SPEC2006
benchmark.
