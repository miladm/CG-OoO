\subsubsection{Branch Prediction Access}

To avoid fetch bubbles in the instruction flow stream, in conventional
processors, BPU is accessed immediately after every fetch, prior to decoding the
instruction types. On average, this creates 2x extra lookups to the BPU exposes
the BPU to unnecessary aliasing mis-speculations and extra energy overhead.

Ahead BPU lookup can prevent accessing the BPU on every instruction. In this
work, once the decode stage detects a new basic-block \texttt{Head} instruction,
    BB Scheduler allocates a new BB Window to the upcoming fetched instructions
    and uses the BR ADDR field in \texttt{Head} to lookup the next basic-block
    destination in BPU (see Figure~\ref{bb_arch}). Since \texttt{Head} comes
    before the branch instruction, ahead prediction avoid bubbles in fetch while
    reducing the number of lookups to BPU by 2x.

%how often H and BR are fetched together? should we keep the branch offset?

Global read operands of instructions in a BB are stored
