\subsection{Basicblock Structure}
\label{sec:bb_struct}

What: discuss bb binary structure including its header contents: branch address.
Also explain the hardware support structure to hold register renamed values for
each global operands (both rad and write). it also contains the BB SN.

Why: to show how we save energy by BP lookup and energy efficient renaming
(renaming buffer is tiny, and cheap to access for both ready-check and wake-up
 logic). energy efficient and more high performance branch prediction.

(make a note that bb header for holding register operands is a CAM array)

% Basicblock boundaries are explicitly annotated by the compiler in the program
% binary through special header instructions (H) that contain certain key
% information about the BB; H instructions hold the BB branch instruction address
% (unless the BB is terminated without a branch or jump operation), global read
% registers, and global write registers used in the BB. Figure XX illustrates the
% organization of each H instruction.
% 
% Contrary to existing processors where the branch-prediction unit (BPU) is looked
% up on every fetch group regardless of the type of instructions in the fetch
% group, BB looks up the branch predictor only through H instructions. Immediately
% after the decode stage, H instructions feed the address of the upcoming branch
% instruction to BPU to find the PC of the next basicblock. This approach
% significantly reduces the traffic to BPU reducing mis-predictions due to
% aliasing and lookup energy consumed unnecessarily by non-branch instructions.
% 
% Global write registers used by instructions in the basicblock are incorporated
% in H so that ?.
% 
% Global read registers used by instructions in the basicblock are incorporated
% in H so that the wake-up logic would simply ?.
