\subsection{Basicblock Scheduling}
\label{sec:scheduling}

This unit is broken into two main sub-units: instruction issue and instruction
update. The instruction issue unit looks for ready instructions at the
head of each basicblock window buffer on every cycle. The instruction udpate
unit updates global and local register values.

Update unit discussion goes here. It talks about updating local registers and
their ready bits, and updating basicblock headers to indicate if the global
operands of different instructions in a basicblock are ready.

Issue unit discussion goes here. It talks about how the issue unit checks the
corresponding local and global operands of an instruction to determine if the
instruction is ready. Global operands availability is checked by looking up the
BB header (where the update unit marks a valid bit for each pgysical global
operand that is ready) and the local operands are checked by lookup
their up valid bit in the corresponding LRF. 

Here we also discuss the energy efficiency implications of looking up the head
of 16 basicblock buffers rather than blasting through a 120 entry instruction
window (which is a CAM array). We also discuss how basicblock headers help
reduce the number of check-for-ready-operands accesses to GRF by keeping ready
information for each global register value in the header of the BB.
