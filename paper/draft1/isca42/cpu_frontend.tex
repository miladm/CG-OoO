\subsection{CPU Frontend}
\label{sec:cpu_frontend}

discussion of register renaming and branch prediction lookup and update models.

% The processor frontend consists of the branch-prediction, fetch, decode, and
% register rename stages. Branch prediction only looks up H instructions. Fetch
% and decode stages are designed similar to existing architectures with
% configurable withs of 2, 4, 8. Contrary to the OoO model where register renaming
% happens in dispatch stage, here register renaming is done right after decode
% (explain why).  The register rename unit is only accessed by H instructions.
% Local registers do not access the register rename unit.
% 
% Given the smaller utility of register renaming, this processor can use a
% smaller set of physical registers (less area and energy per access).
