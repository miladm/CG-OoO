\subsection{Backend}
\label{sec:cpu_backend}

The backend consists of several basic-block window buffers used to store
basic-block operations and the meta-data associated with each BB, local registers
for each basic-block, a global register file, execution units, basic-block re-order
buffer (BBROB), a load-store queue model, and the wake-up logic.
