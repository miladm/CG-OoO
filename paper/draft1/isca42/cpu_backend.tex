\subsection{CPU Backend}
\label{sec:cpu_backend}

The backend consists of several basicblock window buffers used to store
basicblock operations and the meta-data associated with each BB, local registers
for each basicblock, a global register file, execution units, basicblock reorder
buffer (BBROB), a load-store queue model, and the wake-up logic.
