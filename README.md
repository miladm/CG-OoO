## PhArS: A Phraseblock CPU Architecture Simulator and Compiler Backend for CG-OoO

# README #

In this repo you find several CPU architecture models including an Out-of-order (OoO), in-order (InO), and coarse-grain out-of-order (GC-OoO). The exception model takes advantage of the Pin Tool instrumentation API. You also find a detailed energy modeling solution for each CPU subcomponent.
